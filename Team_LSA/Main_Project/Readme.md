## Installation

OS X & Linux:

1. Install the dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

2. Verify the crawler spider exists

```sh
scrapy list
```
if you see `twittercrawler` than you are all set.


Windows:
1. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already
2. Download the project. https://github.com/amitupreti/Hands-on-WebScraping/archive/master.zip
3. Extract the project 
4. Open cmd and navigate inside the project directory
```sh
cd Hands-on-WebScraping/project1_twitter_hashtag_crawler
```
5. Follow step 1 and 2 from Mac/Linux installation



## Usage example

1. Put the hashtags in a csv file seperated by new line. For example, I have included `myhashtags.csv` as a sample.

2. Run the crawler with your hashtag file and the desired [output formats] (https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html)(JSON,JSON lines,CSV,XML)

* For csv
   ```sh
    scrapy crawl twittercrawler -a filename=myhashtags.csv -o mydata.csv

   ```
   
* For JSON
   ```sh
    scrapy crawl twittercrawler -a filename=myhashtags.csv -o mydata.json

   ```

### Speeding up theÂ crawls
If you feel like the crawler is a little slow then find the hashtag.py file in the project and edit the custom settings.
```py
custom_settings = {
    'USER_AGENT': 'Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) Safari/537.36',
    'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS': 2, 'DOWNLOAD_DELAY': 1, 'LOG_LEVEL': 'INFO'}
```
> Here CONCURRENT_REQUESTS is the number of URLs that will be processed parallelly and DOWNLOAD_DELAY is a wait between each  request. So, Increase CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and decrease DOWNLOAD_DELAY (minimum value for download delay is 0).
